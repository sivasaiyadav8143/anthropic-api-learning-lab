# Anthropic API Learning Lab

A collection of my hands‑on practice notebooks and experiments while learning the Anthropic Claude API. This repo documents my exploration of prompts, workflows, agents, and API patterns from the *Claude with the Anthropic API* course—extended with my own notes, tests, and practical examples.

## What’s Inside
- Practice notebooks inspired by the course  
- My own experiments with prompts, tools, and workflows  
- Mini‑projects built while understanding Claude’s API  
- Notes and observations added along the way  

## Purpose
This repo serves as my personal learning lab—capturing how I practiced, iterated, and built confidence using the Anthropic API through real code and experimentation.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Anthropic SDK  
- Jupyter Notebooks  

## Status
Actively expanding as I progress through the course and explore more advanced agentic patterns.
